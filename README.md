Various Machine Learning projects

"Titanic Tester" Predicts the survival chance for passengers on the titanic based on various factors. To run this code, please download "titanic_train.csv" and "titanic_test.csv" to your working directory

"Mushroom Classifier" creates a KNN algorithm to classify mushrooms as poisonous or edible. This pulls from an online database, please make sure to run the pip install at the top of the file.

"Grid Search Classifier" implements a grid search method from scratch for the same purpose. This runs from the same online dataset as the mushroom classifier, so once again ensure you have run the pip install
